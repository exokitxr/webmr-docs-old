# Installing the SDK

   *  Instead of SDK it would probably be a "boilerplate" repo, plus tutorial videos that we will be making. You don't really need anything except exokit itself to start, but we know people like to start with an example site + server script. This is a 1.0-level feature that we will be working on soon as time allows.
