# Welcome to the Exokit Docs

## A Browser for the Post - Screen Era.

 * We have always dreamed of the future as a species, from Back to the Future to the recent Ready Player One, we are a society of dreamers when it comes to imagining what we can create with technology. In order to make that future a reality, we constantly push towards newer, faster, ever improving mediums. Connecting to the internet, and the creativity of web development, have both been things that as of late, have been a bit stabilized in how things are done, with Exokit, we hope to change that.

 * The mission statement of Exokit and its team is that we are going to empower people to construct their own realities. “We want to empower VR and web developers with AR features today. In particular we'd like to move the ball forward on amazing new APIs provided by the MLSDK, and experiment with native integrations between the web and existing 3D engines like Unreal and Unity (which a lot of developer are clamoring for). And of course we think the world could use a truly hackable, embeddable, post-screen web browser that doesn't move at a glacial pace (in both performance and features).” As the quote states, along with Magic Leaps release of its SDK (software development kit), a lot can be done in order to move forward with the development of new avenues of connection, web experiences, and real life integration, which is exactly the space Exokit hopes to fill.
