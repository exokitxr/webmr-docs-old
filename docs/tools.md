# Essential Tools for Exokit Platform

**What initial downloads, languages, and any other programs/features should the dev be immediately aware of?**

   * If you're just using exokit, grab a binary release [here](https://get.webmr.io/). 
   
   * If you're just deving a site w/exokit you will only need that release for now.
   
## Building Exokit
   
If you are looking to develop, extend, or embed the browser somewhere else, you'll need:

  * git
  * Node v10+ ([install instructions](http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/install-node-js-npm-window))
  * npm
  
For OS X, you'll also need:

  * XCode (from Mac App Store)
  
Then to build:

  * Pull from GitHub (`git clone git@github.com:webmixedreality/exokit`)
  * Build with npm (`npm install`)
