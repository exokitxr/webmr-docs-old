# Essential Tools for Exokit Platform
**What initial downloads, Languages, and any other programs/features should the dev be immediately aware of?**

   * If you're just using exokit, grab a binary release [here](https://get.webmr.io/). 
   
   * If you're just deving a site w/exokit you will only need that release for now.
   
   * If you are looking to develop, extend, or embed the browser somewhere else, then you'll want to pull from git and build with npm. The only requirements for that are git and node 10+. Then you npm install the usual way, [here](http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/install-node-js-npm-windows) is a link on how to do that just in case.
