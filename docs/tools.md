# Essential Tools for Exokit Platform
   ## What initial downloads, Languages, and any other programs/features should the dev be immediately aware of?

   *If you're just using exokit, grab a binary release. https://get.webmr.io/
   
   *If you're just deving a site w/exokit you probably still only care about the binary release, plus https://docs.webmr.io/
   
   *If you want to actually dev/extend/embed the browser somewhere else, then you'll want to pull from git and build with npm. The only requirements for that are git and node 10+. Then you npm install the usual way.
