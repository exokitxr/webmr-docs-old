# Before You Begin
   ## Things to Be Sure You Have
   
   * A VR-capable GPU, since you're dealing with VR-style sites.
   
   * If applicable, headset supported by OpenVR, which is most headsets on the market.
   
   * Broadband internet which means it passes the Youtube HD test, which is not a high requirement but also not universal.
   
   * Windows/OSX/Linux. Currently only Windows does VR, OSX coming soon, Linux someday!
   
   * If you're embedding exokit in another app, node 10+ will be required.
   
   * And since you'll be coding, a text editor(aka IDE), any.
