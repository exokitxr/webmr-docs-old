# Before You Begin
**Things to Be Sure You Have**
   
   * A VR-capable GPU, since you're dealing with VR-style sites.
   
   * If applicable, a headset supported by OpenVR really helps with testing your code. Most headsets on the market will do the trick.
   
   * Broadband internet, which means it passes the Youtube HD test, it's not a high requirement but also not universal, so just be sure that you know what you are working with.
   
   * Windows/OSX/Linux as an OS. Currently only Windows does VR, OSX coming soon, and Linux after that!
   
   * If you're embedding exokit in another app, node 10+ will be required.
   
   * And since you'll be coding, a text editor(aka IDE) to make your vision a virtual reality.
