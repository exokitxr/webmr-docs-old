# What Languages to Use and API's

   * We recommend HTML, JS, GLSL, and THREE.js when coding for Exokit.
   
   * Our current supported API's include Magic Leap API, Leap Motion API, Chromum 2D API, mutiplayer API, identity API, with more to come as we work through making it so Exokit is supported on all kinds of tech.
