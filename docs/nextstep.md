# Next Steps

   * When you run "Exokit Browser" a command prompt and a larger window will open, turn your attention to the larger window. In the window you will see a VR keyboard for our VR users (or legacy if you have time to kill), a URL bar, and flat boxes below the bar. Those boxes are our "Featured Sites" from our reddit (see below for how to submit sites for feature). Go ahead and enter any VR website URL, or point-and-click on any of the sites on the boxes below.
    
   * To submit VR website links head over to our reddit page [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/exokit/). You are allowed to post a link only once in the forum, as the featured links are randomized for now. Feel free to comment what the site is below in the comments of each websites post.

**Controls**
    
   * When on a "non-VR only" (e.g. Magic Leap) form of entering Exokit, you will not be immediatly loaded into VR. Go ahead and hit enter VR with F1, enter VR on a Magic Leap with F2.
    
   * For Menu Access (the homepage URL bar and keyboard), "E" opens menu if using a keyboard, with a HTC Vive, accessing the menu comes by hitting the button ABOVE the thumb trackpad.
