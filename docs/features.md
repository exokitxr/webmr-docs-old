# Other Features and Libraries

   * Shouldn't need anything to start, it's regular web APIs.
   
   * However, recommended is to use either THREE.js, Aframe, React 360, or even another full engine that can compile to web, such as Unity. We support WebASM.
   
   * We also do add some extra APIs to do things other browsers can't, for Magic Leap, Leap Motion, UDP, and multiplayer, and more in the future.
